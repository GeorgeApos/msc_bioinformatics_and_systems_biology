    "### Loops\n",
    "Sometimes, we want to do the same thing multiple times. To avoid writing practically the same line of code over and over, we can use a loop. The most commonly used type of loop is called a 'for-loop'. It executes a block of code multiple times for different values of a specified loop-variable. The different values that this loop-variable will take can be provided in any object that can contain multiple values, such as a list, or a tuple, or even a numpy array. A for-loop starts with the keyword **for**, followed by the name of the loop-variable you want to use (you can choose this yourself). Next, we get the keyword **in** followed by the list or other structure that we want to loop over. Finally, we get a colon and an indented block containing the code we want to execute for each value of the loop-variable. This code block is now executed as many times as there are entries in the list we are looping over. The first time the loop-variable will contain the value of the first element of the list, the second time it will contain the second element etc.\n"
